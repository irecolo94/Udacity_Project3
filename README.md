# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project consists in an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Procedure
The starter code was provided by Udacity. I modified `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. I have also applied a small modification to `index.html` as well as `style.css` to make the application responsive.
